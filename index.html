				<h3>More about Me</h3>
					<p><h3>My name is Craig Schultz.  I am currently going to devCodeCamp in order to change careers.  I have been in the IT support industry for roughly 15 years.  While I have had some good jobs and have worked for some good companies, I haven't been getting the satisfaction out of the work that I use to.  There are other reasons for this change as well; better opportunities, better pay, and a real sense of contributing to a business.  I never even thought of changing careers this late in the game until my wife thought it might be a good idea.  She mentioned that her place of employment has been hiring developers from devCodeCamp and that I should check it out.  She also thought it might be a good fit for me with all my "computer" experience.  So here I am changing careers and really hoping it brings some positive opportunities.</h3></p>
